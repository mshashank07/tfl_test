Hello, 

I have restricted myself to write the test in 1.5 hours 

1) Using Selenium, Specflow and NUnit
2) Created the framework using page object pattern 
2) Psuedo code has written down for all the tests 
3) Tests are passing in debug mode (by cheating the cookies)
4) When running the tests directly will fail because of cookies not handled properly 
5) Objects can be handled correctly if there is time
